# [Kanban Board - Quicksell Frontend Assignment](https://main.d2nq9mz8ggbsl4.amplifyapp.com)

This is a Kanban board app made with React JS that works with an API from [Quick Internal API for frontend Assignment](https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment). It lets users easily arrange the board by grouping tickets by status, user, or priority. You can also sort tickets by priority or title. The app saves your view so that everything stays the same, even after refreshing the page. Itâ€™s a simple tool that makes organizing tasks more flexible and user-friendly.
